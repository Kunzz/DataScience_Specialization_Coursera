This repo contains the files of the project work for Getting And Cleaning Data course from Coursera.

In addition to this "README.MD", there are three files in this directory.  "run_analysis.R" is the source code to get this dataset. "new_data.text" is the final delivered dataset based on project requirement. "CodeBook.rmd" explains the data files used, transformation performed and definition of each variable.
